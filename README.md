This project implements a Course Database Manager that stores and retrieves course information using a hash table-like data structure. Each course entry includes details such as the Course ID, CRN (course reference number), credits, room number, and instructorâ€™s name. The system supports adding courses, retrieving them by CRN, reading course data from a file, and displaying all stored courses
